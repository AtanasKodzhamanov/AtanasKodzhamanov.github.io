Work on your main branch. This is where you'll make all your changes and updates to your project. Use git add, git commit, and git push to save your changes and push them to the remote repository.

Once you're ready to publish your changes to the web, switch to the gh-pages branch using git checkout gh-pages. This branch is specifically meant for hosting your project's website on GitHub Pages.

If the gh-pages branch doesn't exist, you can create it by running 
git checkout -b gh-pages
This will create a new branch based on your current branch, and switch to it.

Once you're on the gh-pages branch, merge in any changes from your main branch using git merge main. This will bring in all the changes you made on your main branch.

Finally, push your changes to the gh-pages branch to the remote repository using git push origin gh-pages. This will publish your website to GitHub Pages.

Repeat this process each time you make updates to your main branch and want to publish them to the web.
